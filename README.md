Retention Rate Time-based Cohort Analysis(RRTCA)

RRTCA is aspecialized form of CA that focuses on the retention of users over multiple period of times.

To perform RRTCA, we need to:

Create cohort based on the user's acquisistion date
Measure the percentage of users from each cohort who continue to enagage with the product or service over given period of time
Analyze how retention rate varies across various cohorts and time period.
This will allow us to identify trends and enables us to make data insightful decision This will also reveals whether certain cohort have better or worse retention rates, enabling the business to understand the factors contributing to user retention or attrition It can also optimize product market and customer support strategies
